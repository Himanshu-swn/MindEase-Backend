MongoDB Integration: Efficient and scalable data handling using MongoDB with Mongoose.

Authentication & Authorization: Secure JWT-based login system for both doctors and patients.

Appointment Management: Enables booking, viewing, and managing appointments by role.

Error Handling: Consistent error responses and structured logging for smooth debugging.
